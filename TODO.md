# TODO

Ordered by importance within each section.

## Client / monitor

* Send the day's whole `event_log` and the last `crash.log` entry with each
  sync, so debugging works from the server page without machine access; cap
  the crash log at 1 MB (rename to `.old`) and read only its tail.
* A changed time zone, which a standard user may set, moves the clock out of the
  night and rolls the date into a fresh limit. When the Windows zone name
  changes, log an event for the parent's page.

## Server-side

* Test the server against the report of each released monitor version, since
  it has to stay compatible with every one still installed (see the README).
* `settings_in_words` hardcodes the five setting names, while the rest of the
  settings path takes names and types from whatever the child reports. A
  renamed, missing or malformed setting is a 500 on both `/` and `/settings` for
  that child. Render the compact line only when the known names fit, else fall
  back to plain `name=value`.
* Store the `monitor_version` every monitor already sends, in a new nullable
  column of `status`: which version ran when, and whether auto-update lands.
  The live database needs one
  `ALTER TABLE status ADD COLUMN monitor_version TEXT`, by hand.
* Settings UI: a widget per setting, keyed by name (durations, hour picker,
  weekday sliders over `DAILY_LIMIT_OVERRIDES`); unknown names fall back to the
  JSON box. The client stays the validator. A name's meaning never changes,
  new meaning means new name; a server test checks every widget name exists
  in the client's `SETTINGS`.
* Real login: replace BasicAuth with a session cookie and a login form.
* Server logging.
* Simplify installation: family, parent and child creation in the DB and the
  corresponding logins, with less effort from the maintainer.

## Product, once mature

* A general description of what this is, in Czech and English, for the site
  and the top of the README.
* A parent's manual: creating an account, adding children, installing on the
  child's machine. The README covers the install for now.
* In that manual, an optional step that takes the right to change the time
  zone from standard users. `secpol.msc` on Pro; Home needs a try on the test VM.

## Someday / maybe

* Delay a time zone change, if the events show anyone using the trick: count
  by the old UTC offset for 24 hours, with night when either offset says so.
* Full client rewrite in C# with a signed exe installer; the monitor becomes
  a Windows service then.
* Restricted internet, instead of shutdown when the quota ends or as a second
  mode: a firewall rule scoped to the child's account that allows a whitelist
  and nothing else. Maybe Wikipedia alone, maybe limited ChatGPT or Claude.
* A carryover change from the server counts a day late: the day file, with
  its carryover, is created before the day's first sync.
* Several devices for one child, sharing one budget. Server-side only,
  through the existing grants: every device keeps counting and shutting down
  on its own, and the server turns one device's usage into a negative grant
  for its siblings, so all of them converge on the same remaining within a
  tick. Grants and settings changes become addressed to the child, delivered
  and answered per device; `children` splits into `children` and `devices`,
  which own the token and the status rows. No monitor or protocol change, so
  every installed version keeps working. Two devices on at once cost double,
  as an unlocked idle session does today. Offline mode cannot share anything:
  a second install there is a second child, which is also the answer to give
  until a customer asks for more. Not before the server is tested against a
  recorded 0.1.0 sync.
